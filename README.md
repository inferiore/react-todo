This repository was the result of taking successfully the course of [Curso de Introducción a React.js](https://platzi.com/reactjs). To start you must just clone the repository (`git clone`), intall its dependecies  (`npm i`) and execute the app (`npm start`).

The main branch has the base-code the course stared with and my personal commits. In the gh-pages you will find the static files that are needed to deploy the app using GitHub Pages. The project can be watched at the following [link](https://inferiore.github.io/react-todo/)
